# Full-Stack System for a Motor Repair Company  

This project is designed to assist a motor repair company with no prior system in place by building a full-stack solution that includes two key components:  

## 1. **Booking System (Frontend)**  
The booking system serves as the **customer-facing interface**. Through this website, customers can:  
- *Learn more about the company and its services.*  
- **Schedule an appointment** for repairs, allowing the company to prepare the necessary materials and allocate time efficiently.  

This ensures customers won't face **unnecessary delays** or *wasted trips*.  

## 2. **Database Management System (Backend)**  
The database system is the **internal-facing tool** for the company. It enables staff to:  
- **Manage customer and supplier information.**  
- Track *purchases*, *sales*, and **inventory levels**.  
- Generate **reports** for analysis and decision-making.  
- View and manage **booking details** seamlessly.  

This system streamlines the companyâ€™s operations and enhances both *customer experience* and **internal efficiency**.
